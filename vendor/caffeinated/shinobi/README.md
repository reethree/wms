Shinobi brings a simple and light-weight role-based permissions system to Laravel's built in Auth system. Shinobi brings support for the following ACL structure:

- Every user can have zero or more roles.
- Every role can have zero or more permissions.

Permissions are then inherited to the user through the user's assigned roles.

The package follows the FIG standards PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code. At the moment the package is not unit tested, but is planned to be covered later down the road.
